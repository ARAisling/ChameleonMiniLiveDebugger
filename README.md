This application is an interactive NFC debugging and logging tool for Android using the [Chameleon Mini](https://github.com/emsec/ChameleonMini) Rev. g boards using [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CXAC1ZW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) USB cable (or some variant thereof). The Chameleon Mini is a hardware tool for NFC debugging, card emulation, security testing, reconnaissance, and general purpose debugging over this interface. These small card-sized NFC emulator devices are able to clone contact-less cards and RFID tags and sniff the raw RF-framed data sent over the interface without the overhead of Android's prohibitive NFC stack. Recent versions of the Chameleon boards (Rev. >= g) have the option to perform LIVE logging with the device where the raw logs are printed to the console in real time. This application provides a portable interface to be used with the live logging features of the device for on the go and stealth NFC card reader debugging and testing. A Beta testing version of the application is now available on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maxieds.chameleonminilivedebugger). There are also current [themed versions](https://github.com/maxieds/ChameleonMiniLiveDebugger/wiki#themes) of the app available for download on the [releases](https://github.com/maxieds/ChameleonMiniLiveDebugger/releases) page.

# Licensing and Credits

For all intensive reasonable non-commercial applications this app is free to use and modify provided a link to the original project webpage and the author information remain intact in the revisions (i.e., at minimum a copy of this README.md file and a link to the [source repo](https://github.com/maxieds/ChameleonMiniLiveDebugger) must be included with any re-distribution). Call this licensing scheme GPL-like. The bulk of the pretty stylized freeware icons used by the app were obtained from the [Flat Icon site](flaticon.com) and their lovely sized transparent PNG conversions of these images.

# Donations / Contributing to the Project

The app is freeware so instead of adding a PayPal account for good Samaritan user donations, I will just point out that I would like to have another couple of these devices to play with and loan to friends for another private app I'm developing. If anyone finds this app useful and has the resources to donate an extra Chameleon or two (any revision should do the trick), please contact me. I'd also be interested in obtaining one of the Rev. E boards for testing with the app and some of the Proxmark hardware for coding related applications. 
Additionally, you can contribute to the development of the app by providing [debugging information](https://github.com/maxieds/ChameleonMiniLiveDebugger/issues/1) and [feature requests](https://github.com/maxieds/ChameleonMiniLiveDebugger/issues/2) on the [issues thread](https://github.com/maxieds/ChameleonMiniLiveDebugger/issues) for the project.
