This application is an interactive NFC debugging and logging tool for Android using the [Chameleon Mini](https://github.com/emsec/ChameleonMini) Rev. g boards using [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CXAC1ZW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) USB cable (or some variant thereof). The Chameleon Mini is a hardware tool for NFC debugging, card emulation, security testing, reconnaissance, and general purpose debugging over this interface. These small card-sized NFC emulator devices are able to clone contact-less cards and RFID tags and sniff the raw RF-framed data sent over the interface without the overhead of Android's prohibitive NFC stack. Recent versions of the Chameleon boards (Rev. >= g) have the option to perform LIVE logging with the device where the raw logs are printed to the console in real time. This application provides a portable interface to be used with the live logging features of the device for on the go and stealth NFC card reader debugging and testing. A Beta testing version of the application is now available on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maxieds.chameleonminilivedebugger).
